## Skills
As a data scientist, I possess the following skills:

- Machine learning
- Data visualization
- Python programming
- SQL
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and evaluation
- Data storytelling

## Education
- New Zealand Certificate in Information Technology (Level 5) from Southern Institute of Technology
- Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate from Google
- Web Design For Everybody Capstone from University of Michigan

## Webapp Stack
The webapp was built using the following stack:

- Flask as web framework
- MySQL as database
- API to scrape data from Duolingo.com

## Webapp Deployment Attempts
I had initially tried to deploy the webapp on both Heroku and PythonAnywhere, but encountered some issues. Despite making a Procfile and requirements.txt, the deployment did not work as expected. However, the webapp is currently up and running on Azure and has been working well.
