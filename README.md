This is my Portfolio website. An attempt to showcase the projects 
I have done in the past year or so. For now, I have faced some issues 
in deploying it into cloud platforms,like heroku, netlify and pythonanywhere.
Thus, I am submitting this through files instead of just submitting a link.
However, if you have some ideas on how I can improve my portfolio website,
feel free to suggest. 

This project contains flask as web framework, mysql as database, and API to
datascrape duolingo.com. I have also made the Procfile and requirements.txt
in an attempt to deploy the webapp on heroku but to no avail. 
It also has two html files for the webpages.
